  Run ASP.NET Core on Replit®
  <br>
</p>

<br>

## QuickStart

> **Note**: this project is set to use the latest LTS version of the .NET SDK

1. Fork this repository
2. Click the run button
3. Inform the name of your solution when prompted in the terminal
4. Click the run button again to start the project

## How it works

- **replit.nix**: sets the version of the .NET SDK
- **.replit**: makes run button execute file runner.bash
- **runner.bash**: creates ASP.NET Core solution or run it if it already exists
- **project_name.replit**: saves the name of your solution
